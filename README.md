### Hello there

I don't know why you find my repo. It sounds stupid to scroll through my repo, since I'm only a high school student with neither professional training nor splendid projects. However if you happen to be some sort of admission officer, which is highly unlikely, consider me pls. 

This repo is not a project but a place to have a online backup.

Tags: CPP (USACO, CCC, NOIp, ~~ and hopefully ICPC in the future~~), Python (Data Sci. & Web & PyGame), ~~Java (AP CSA only),~~ and also HTML&CSS + LaTeX, if you think they sound like computer languages.

Other tags: Prefer not to Tell.
