abstract = {The thermal behavior of dry solid ascorbic acid in nitrogen atmosphere in the temperature range of 25–800°C was investigated by TG-FTIR. During the thermal decomposition process, five evolved gaseous species, including H2O, CO2, CO, CH4 and HCOOH, were identified and monitored, in which HCOOH was detected for the first time. The results indicated that ascorbic acid began to decompose at 191°C. Its decomposition process consisted of three stages, and dehydration and decarboxylation to form furfural were the possible principal mechanism. The kinetic analysis for the first decomposition stage was also carried out by the isoconversional method and the master plots method. The results indicated that this process can be described by the model of 1st order reaction.}

abstract = {A modified spectrophotometric procedure for the determination of ascorbic acid using dichlorophenolindophenol (DCPIP) is described. The method is simple, sensitive and rapid, and the reagents required are relatively inexpensive. The Fe(II) interference encountered when the previous method was used is greatly reduced by adding EDTA. The presence of up to 400 μM Fe [as Fe(II) or Fe(III)] has no effect on the ascorbic acid determination. By raising the pH at which the determination is made, the stability of DCPIP dye has been improved.}
