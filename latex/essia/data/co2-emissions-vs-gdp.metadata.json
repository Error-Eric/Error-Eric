For example, emissions from imported steel are counted in the country where the steel is produced. To learn more and look at emissions adjusted for trade, read our article: [How do CO₂ emissions compare when we adjust for trade?](https://ourworldindata.org/consumption-based-co2)",
        "The data comes from the Global Carbon Budget. Fossil CO₂ emissions are estimated using national statistics on energy use — such as coal, oil, and gas consumption — and industrial production, particularly cement. These figures are converted into CO₂ emissions using standardized emission factors. For more details, read [the Global Carbon Budget paper](https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-15-5301-2023).",

      "descriptionProcessing": "- Global emissions are converted from tonnes of carbon to tonnes of carbon dioxide (CO₂) using a factor of 3.664. This is the conversion factor [recommended by the Global Carbon Project](https://globalcarbonbudgetdata.org/downloads/jGJH0-data/Global+Carbon+Budget+v2024+Dataset+Descriptions.pdf). It reflects that one tonne of carbon, when fully oxidized, forms 3.664 tonnes of CO₂, based on the relative molecular weights of carbon and oxygen in CO₂.\n- Emissions from the 1991 Kuwaiti oil fires are included in Kuwait's emissions for that year.\n- To calculate CO₂ emissions per capita, we divide the original data by a country's estimated population. These estimates come from our population dataset based on [multiple sources](https://ourworldindata.org/population-sources).\n",
