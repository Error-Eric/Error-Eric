### About this folder

In my High School, we have Pre-DP course on Grade 10, which serve as a transition from the local system to IB system. And at the end of Grade 10, we have a 2-week IB experience which serve as a transition form the Pre-DP course into real IB-DP course. 

These are my practice on taking notes and do proper citation in LaTeX.
